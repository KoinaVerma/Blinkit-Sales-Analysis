# Blinkit sales analysis

This project explores the sales performance of 'Blinkit', an online grocery shopping store using **Power BI** as the primary tool for data visualization and analysis. The goal is to gain insights into various sales aspects, including product category performance, outlet behavior, and revenue generation patterns. By analyzing key metrics and trends, the project provides recommendations to optimize operations and sales strategies.

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

The primary objective of this project is to address the following questions:

- What is the total sales generated across different outlets?
- Which product categories and outlet types contribute the most to revenue?
- How does outlet size, location, and establishment year affect sales?
- What trends in sales performance can be observed, and what strategies can be recommended to improve revenue?

This analysis will assist in decision-making processes related to product offerings, store management, and marketing strategies to enhance sales performance.

This analysis was performed using **Power BI**, leveraging its powerful visualization capabilities and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for KPI creation.

### DATA SOURCE

The data was sourced from Kaggle.com, which provides various fictitious datasets for portfolio projects. This specific dataset contains detailed records of grocery sales, including:

- **Product Information**: Item type, fat content, visibility, and weight.
- **Outlet Information**: Size, type, location, and establishment year.
- **Sales Metrics**: Individual sales records and customer ratings.

### DATA CLEANING

To ensure meaningful insights, the following steps were taken to clean the data:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing weights and outlet sizes were imputed using averages by category.
- **Normalization**: Item visibility values were normalized to correct outliers.
- **Format Corrections**: Date formats were validated, and categorical values were standardized.
- **Data Filtering**: Outliers in the sales column were removed to prevent skewing the analysis.

### ANALYSIS

1. **Total Sales**:
   
   The overall revenue generated from all items sold. I calculated the 'Total Sales' by **summing** all the values in the Sales column. It adds up the revenue generated from each transaction, providing the overall sales figure across all products and outlets. This measure is used in Power BI to display the total sales KPI card on the dashboard.

   ```dax
   Total Sales = SUM('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Sales])
   ```

2. **Average Sales**:
  
   The average revenue per sale. I calculated the 'Average Sales' by taking the **mean** of all values in the Sales column. It provides insight into the typical revenue generated per transaction, helping to evaluate the average spending pattern of customers. This measure is used in Power BI to display the average sales KPI card on the dashboard.

   ```dax
   Avg Sales = AVERAGE('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Sales])
   ```

3. **Number of Items**:

    The total count of different items sold. I calculated the 'No of Items' by **counting** the number of rows in the 'BlinkIT Grocery Data' table, it represents the total number of items or transactions recorded in the dataset. Each row corresponds to a specific product sold, helping to quantify the overall volume of transactions. This measure is used in Power BI to display the no of items KPI card on the dashboard.

   ```dax
   No of Items = COUNTROWS('BlinkIT Grocery Data')
   ```

4. **Average Rating**:
  
   The average customer rating for items sold. I calculated the 'Average Rating' by taking the **mean** of all values in the Rating column. It provides insight into the overall customer satisfaction with the products sold. This measure is used in Power BI to display the average rating KPI card on the dashboard, helping monitor customer feedback and product performance.

   ```dax
   Avg Rating = AVERAGE('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Rating])
   ```

I created a **field metrics** group using the measures Total Sales, Avg Sales, No of Items, and Avg Rating. This helped me efficiently build visualization charts, such as bar charts, line charts, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance and customer satisfaction.

### INSIGHTS

1. **Total Sales Revenue**: The highest revenue is generated by Supermarket Type1 outlets, making them the most profitable type.

2. **Average Sales per Outlet**: Outlets in Tier 1 locations tend to perform better than those in other tiers, suggesting a higher demand in these regions.
   
3. **Sales by Product Category**: Fruits and Vegetables and Frozen Foods are the leading product categories, indicating customer preference.
   
4. **Impact of Outlet Size**: Medium-sized outlets generate the highest sales, indicating an optimal size for operations.
   
5. **Sales Trends**: Sales have increased steadily over the years, with a significant spike after 2015, reflecting potential business expansion or increased demand.
    
6. **Visibility Influence**: Items with moderate visibility tend to have higher sales, indicating that both over- and under-exposure can affect performance negatively.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested to improve Blinkitâ€™s sales performance:

1. **Focus on Expanding Supermarket Type1 Outlets**: Given their strong performance, expanding this type of outlet could further boost revenue.

2. **Optimize Outlet Size for New Locations**: Medium-sized outlets perform best; new stores should align with this size.

3. **Promote High-Performing Categories**: Products like Fruits and Vegetables and Frozen Foods should receive targeted promotions and advertising.

4. **Enhance Operations in Tier 1 Locations**: High demand in Tier 1 suggests prioritizing resources and marketing efforts in these areas.
   
5. **Balanced Product Visibility Strategy**: Maintain optimal visibility for products, avoiding both over-exposure and under-promotion to maximize sales.
   
6. **Seasonal Promotions and Forecasting**: Use the identified trends to forecast demand and run targeted seasonal promotions to capitalize on peak sales periods.

### CONCLUSION

This Blinkit Sales Analysis project provides valuable insights into the performance of outlets and product categories. The findings and recommendations can guide strategic decisions to enhance operations, improve customer satisfaction, and boost sales revenue.
